This folder contains input files for the benchmark
King, Scott D., et al. (2010): "A community benchmark for 2-D 
Cartesian compressible convection in the Earth's mantle." 
Geophysical Journal International 180(1), 73-87.
This includes versions for the ALA and TALA approximations for 
different values of the Dissipation number Di and the Rayleigh 
number Ra. The complete input file can be found in 'ala.prm'. 
All other input files are generated by the 'run_all_models' script 
to run cases with a different approximation or values of Di and Ra.
All models can be started by

  bash run_all_models

to run a model with a specific set of setting you can modify the loops
inside of this script to only generate models you are interested in. 

The bash script 'get_statistics' can extract the relevant statistics
(Nusselt number, root mean square velocity, average temperature, 
total shear heating and total adiabatic heating in the last time step) 
of one or several model runs and copy it to the screen output and a 
separate file (king_statistics.txt)
It takes one or several paths to a number of statistics 
files as input parameters, for example:

bash get_statistics Di0.25_Ra1e4_refinement4_ala

or 

bash get_statistics Di0.25_Ra1e4_refinement4_ala Di0.5_Ra1e4_refinement4_ala 

(assuming Di0.25_Ra1e4_refinement4_ala Di0.5_Ra1e4_refinement4_al 
are the output directories of the model runs).
